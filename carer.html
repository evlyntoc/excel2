<p>
Once again, a beautiful evening to everyone. Going through our introductions, it's crystal clear all our dear girls have great dreams as regards your future careers.<br>
A career can be define as any discipline, profession or vocation (acquired skills) engaged in to earn a living. Choice refers to a preferred or selected option from a multitude of options, opportunities, items or ideas.<br>
Chosing a career could be a bit indecisive as your preferred choice could sometimes change as you grow older or depends on your feelings, parental influence or even peer pressure. <br>
So what are the factors to consider when it comes to a career choice? <br>
	<br>

1YOU<br>
Yes, you are the most important factor to consider when it comes to chosing a career because your career has to do with 95% of your adult life, your future happiness and satisfaction, thus understanding what is best for YOU is very important because you are the one who is going to be doing this job for years to come.<br>
Thus, before you can choose the right career, you must learn about yourself. Your values, interests, skills, aptitudes, characters, your strength and weaknesses, the subjects you are good at, your health condition and so on. A clear understanding of yourÂ personality traits and temperament will make some occupations a good fit for you and others completely inappropriate.<br>
<br>
QUESTION: Do a self evaluation of your personality traits, your strength and weaknesses and reflect on how they affect your preferred career.
<br>
	<br>
		<br>
			2. YOUR PASSION AND INTERESTS <br>
Your passions or interest refers to those things you can do with ease and less stress. The things you enjoy doing and are passionate about. When the daily routine of your career involves your passion or interest, work becomes a pleasure and not a burden nor stress. Remember, your career is something you are going to be doing for the larger part of your life, hence, chosing in line with something you are talented or good at is an added advantage to you.
Am glad all our dear girls have been able to identify the things they enjoy doing during our introduction session, now I will like you to re evaluate your interest in line with your preferred career choice and answer the question below...<br>
QUESTION 2: Make a list of your hobbies or interests and identify how they relate to your preferred career choice<br>
	<br>
		<br>
			3. RESEARCH <br>
Before you conclude on your career choice,  it is necessary to carry out adequate research on all the possible career options that are in line with your subjects of study or requirements. Browse the internet, talk with you Career Counselor on choices you can explore outside the popular ones, for instance, I noticed almost every girl here wants to be a doctor, an engineer or accountant, beautiful! But no one mentioned Journalism, despite the fact that many love writing, reading and exploring. No one wants to be a teacher. No one mentioned Public Administration, International Relations, Architecture, Geology, Sociology, Political Science to mention a few. <br>
I would had really been impressed if some of our girls had dreams of restructuring this nation politically, helping to create a better public sector, or excellent education system.<br>
A proper research will expose you to great varieties with less competition and rewarding prospects (pay) you can choose from. <br>
Moreover, for those of us that wants to be doctors and engineers, researching to know the particular branch of the course you want to study in this field, is very important. Also of note is the need to know the various universities that offer your preferred course, the financial implications, if they are within your parents, guardian or sponsors capability and the scholarship options available to you. Research is very important.<br>
	<br>
		<br>
			4.EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES<br>
Another point to note in chosing a career is the level of employment opportunities open to you in your chosen field.<br>
QUESTION: Where are the likely places you can be employed with your preferred career? How readily available are jobs in this field? Who are your likely employers?<br>
In the absence of no employers can you be self employed?<br>
<br>
	<br>
5. JOB STABILITY: This refer to relevance in the job market, a job that is resistant to social, technological and economy changes and challenges. A career that will ALWAYS be in demand by human community is a good choice worth considering when it comes to making a career choice.<br>
	<br>
		<br>
QUESTION 4: How relevant will your preferred career be to society 20 years from now? Give reasons for your answer.<br>
	<br>
		<br>

6. FINANCIAL BENEFITS<br>
A lucrative career is one with a a good monetary value, pay or salary. Remember we said a career is a job through which you earn a living. The essence of you working is so that you can live a comfortable life in future, take care of yourself, your family and even contribute to the betterment of others in the society. Thus, the financial benefits attached to your preferred career cannot be overlooked. A satisfying career is one that you enjoy doing and in which the pay is good enough to earn you deserved respect. <br>
Though, all careers may not have the same financial rates, and that's because the risk and time involved in each profession differs, but the pay must be good enough to earn you a responsible livelihood.<br> 
	<br>
	In conclusion, permit me to say, YOU are your CAREER and your CAREER is YOU. Because your future happiness and satisfaction is going to be tied to your CHOICE , hence the BEST decision you can ever make is to wisely chose what is BEST FOR YOU!
