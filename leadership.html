<p> *Definition*

▶️  Leadership is the action of leading group of people or an organization. For example 
<br>
1.	*Organization*-: in this place, the Chief Executive Officer ( CEO)  or Exective Director ( ED) is the leader<br>

<br>
2.	*School:* in this place, the principal, head teacher, proprietor, proprietress is the leader<br>

<br>
3.	*Nation/ Country:* in tgis place, the president or prime minister is the leader<br>

<br>
4.	*State:* in this place,  the governor is the leader<br>

<br>
5.	*Religious bodies ( Church or Mosque):* in this place,  the Pastor or Imam is the leader<br>

<br>
6.	*Home:* in this place,  the father is the leader. And in the absence of the father, the mother assume leadership role.<br>
<br>

<br>
There are various definition of leadership but I will mention just few: 
<br>
▶️. It is the process of social life in which a person can enlist the aid and supply of others in the accomplishments of a common task
<br>
▶️	It is the ability of an individual to influence and guide other members of a particular group , association or organization
<br>
▶️	A process which the leaser directs, guides, and influence the behaviour or work of others
<br>
▶️.	*According to Forbes , it is a process of social influence which maximizes the efforts of others towards achieving a goal*<br>

<br>
👆For this class we shall take the<br>
<br>
<br>
👉🏽 A good leader would influence( ability to persuade) his or her team members or followers to *maximize their capacity, creativity, towards achieving a goal*<br>
<br>
<br>
*Types of Leadership Style*✍🏽✍🏽✍🏽✍🏽✍🏽
<br>

<br>
I.	*Autocratic* – this style of leader believes he or she is the smartest and do not give others opportunity to air their views.<br>

<br>
II.	*Authoritative:* This is a leader who map the way and set expectations, while engaging and energizing followers along the way<br>

<br>
III.	*Pacesetting:* this is a very driven leader who sets the pace high. Pacesetters set the bar high and push their team members to run hard and fast to the finish line. Though effective in getting things done and driving for results, it's a style that can hurt team members. For one thing, even the most driven employees may become stressed working under this style of leadership in the long run.<br>

<br>
IV.	*Democratic:*  this leader is likely to ask "What do you think?" They share information with their team about anything that affects reaching their goals and  responsibilities. They also seek their team's  opinions before approving a final decision<br>

<br>
V.	*Coaching:* in  a coaching leadership style, the leader tend to have a "Consider this" approach. A leader who coaches views people as a reservoir of talent to be developed. The leader who uses a coach approach seeks to unlock people's potential. coaching leader gives people a little direction to help them tap into their ability to achieve all that they're capable of.<br>

<br>
VI.	*Affiliative:* in this type of leadership, the people come first." Of all the leadership styles, the affiliative leadership approach is one where the leader gets up close and personal with people. A leader practicing this style pays attention to and supports the emotional needs of team members. The leader strives to open up a pipeline that connects him or her to the team.Ultimately, this style is all about encouraging harmony and forming collaborative relationships within teams. It's particularly useful, for example, in smoothing conflicts among team members or reassuring people during times of stress<br>

<br>
VII.	*Laissez faire:* The laissez-faire leadership style is at the opposite end of the autocratic style. Of all the leadership styles, this one involves the least amount of oversight. You could say that the autocratic style leader stands as firm as a rock on issues, while the laissez-faire leader lets people swim with the current. On the surface, a laissez-faire leader may appear to trust people to know what to do, but taken to the extreme, an uninvolved leader may end up appearing aloof. While it's beneficial to give people opportunities to spread their wings, with a total lack of direction, people may unwittingly drift in the wrong direction—away from the critical goals of the organization. This style can work if the leader is  leading highly skilled, experienced team members who are self-starters and motivated.<br>
