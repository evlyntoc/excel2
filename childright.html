Child rights are rights of children regardless of  age, race, gender, wealth or birthplace, has rights.<br>
<br><br>
These rights are enshrined in international law in the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). It recognises all children must be treated fairly, equally and with dignity. The child rights convention laws are non-discriminatory and are always in the best interests of the child.<br>
<br><br>
Further explained every child on Earth has a right individually like one of you once sighted an example of the right to go to school.
<br><br>
The key note to be noted  is that every child on Earth has a right.
<br><br>
Imagine you being in a class  for example ,am certain there are certain right you have as a student in a class.and without this right it is very easy for any of other class mate to bully you around yes or no?
<br>
Okay before we proceed further with child right . since we have different answer to the question asked previously, can someone tell me the right you enjoyed has a student in school, which prevents  you from being bullied by others
<br><br>
Why are rights important?<br>
Human rights are important because it guarantee people the means necessary to satisfy their basic needs, such as food, housing, and education, so they can take full advantage of all opportunities. Finally, by guaranteeing life, liberty, equality, and security, human rights protect people against abuse by those who are more powerful
<br><br>
As stated earlier on every child on Earth has a right, which enable every child on Earth to enjoy certain privileges and without this right  being stated in a law or a convention it would be very easy for any child to be deprived of it.
<br><br>
And in other for any child not to be deprived of their individual right . this right in which we have as individuals are enshrined in international law in the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). It recognises all children must be treated fairly, equally and with dignity. The child rights convention laws are non-discriminatory and are always in the best interests of the child.<br>
<br><br>
However the The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) is a legally-binding international agreement setting out the civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights of every child, regardless of their race, religion or abilities.<br>
<br>
	<br>

<br>
 In summary every child has a right and this right are being safe guarded and ensured  by the government in order to prevent any child from being deprived of the right listed above<br>
<br>
Now that we have discussed about the right of a  child be aware that their are certain rights that  you are not privileged to have for now but in future when you all grow up to the age of 18 ,can someone state an example of such right<br>
<br>
Always have this in mind you all has an individual has a right...As for your assignment give me  nine  right you have as a child and nine right you don't have for now as a child but in future when you are 18.
