 I am Uzoma Egwu Okoro and I will be taking you on self confidence.
<br><br>
	
I'm so glad to be able to talk to you on self-confidence. It is such an important topic i think young girls must know about. I will be talking with you using a teenage perspective. I will try not to sound too adult or too childish, somewhat in the middle. Hope that's okay? The class is going to be interactive and i will love that you ask questions and share experiences as we proceed? I hope you have already been told that this a safe space so feel free and protected, please.
<br><br>
So let us begin, can you please tell me what you understand by by self confidence.
<br><br>
When you are self confident, you believe in yourself and trust in your judgement. As women, we have a huge responsibilty to try to be self confident and have self esteem . It will determine how far we go and how we are able to stand up for ourselves. The confidence you have in yourself is so evident, it glows and everyone can notice it. Some of the models, celebrities and public figures we admire have one thing in common, they present a notion of themselves as self confident. Everyone wants to reckon with a self confident girl, there is simply something cool about them and here is why.
<br><br>
a self confident girl believes in herself and her capabilities.<br>
-a self confident girl believes in herself; since she believes in herself others also believe in her; a self confident girl does not require validation or acceptance before loving herself thus, she does not have the "inferiority complex". <br>
- a self confident girl feels proud of herself and accomplishments and so she handles difficulties without downgrading herself or others.<br>
<br>
Okay, let's take some time out, by naming one self confident woman you know, apart from you,of courseðŸ˜‰Then tell me one main self-confident characteristic that she possesses. Let's do this shortly
<br><br>
 I have been where you are not up to ten years ago and  understand the challenges most teenage girls face. There are a lot of changes going on in your life and body that understanding who you are may still be very challenging. But, i want you to know that you are special and one of a kind. No kidding, really.  God made each and everyone of us with a special intention in mind so we are unique.
<br><br>
Most teenage girls also suffer from inferiority complex. Perhaps, friends and classmates in school may make some people feel like they aren't smart enough, beautiful enough, slim enough etc. If you are in the category of those who talk down to others, and make others feel incomplete, Kindly stop and know that for you to be doing that you must have a problem in order to be able to hurt others.  For girls who experience this in school, you have to realise that if you tell yourself how okay you are, no one else will be able to tell you otherwise. I have a younger sister, who came home crying one day that her friends kept saying she was 'fat'.  I had to scold her never to cry over such things, I asked her if any of her friends were really better than her and she said no.
<br><br>
I used to face similar challenges. In school I was sometimes tease for not being tall enough, not being as pretty and not having a long hair like other girls, or even being fat. Despite being smart and intelligent, i could not just help but be moved by all their words. I cut down on foods, prayed to God to make me taller, tried everything but i just ended up being depressed. However, University changed many things.
<br><br>
When I wasn't with these people who made me feel that way daily, I saw that they weren't much better than I was. I was in a class of mixed multitude of people and I saw that wow! I stood out because of how different I was.
<br><br>
I understand and before I leave end the class I will tell you how you can walk through this challenge.
<br><br>
1. Gain knowledge, read and empower yourself. I applaud you for being here because this is a good step towards feeling better about yourself. American/Kenyan actress, Lupita Nyongo once said to African girls to always believe that your dreams are valid. To get to those dreams, you need to be ambitious and you have to be knowledgeable. Knowledge is power, and that will be your armor in protecting your self esteem.
<br><br>
2. Know that everybody is beautiful in their own right. God made us unique. I had a friend called Samuel. Samuel was not tall, but he is the first boy I know who wasn't bothered about it. He was so confident that everyone always wanted to be around him. One day I asked him, "Samuel,  how do you do it? Doesn't your height bother you? I will never forget his answer, he said to me " It used to, but now I know GOD DOESN'T MAKE A MISTAKE.
<br><br>
3. Understand grooming. You don't have to dress expensively before you look nice. As you grow, you will learn what your body structure is and how to dress accordingly to it. This will change as time passes, and that's normal. Have a neat appearance so that no one can have the opportunity to put you down.
<br><br>
4. Know your unique talent and abilities and own it. 
<br><br>
   God gave each and every one of us special gifts and abilities. Don't try to copy someone else to (that is different from having a role model). You can be a good writer, singer, conversationist etc. When you identify it, try to be good at it. This will help you stand out always. You can also be good at many things also.
<br><br>
 Lastly, please  girl's always believe in yourself, be confident and dream big. Also remember that life isn't a competition, we are here with different destinies and we are helping each other in fulfilling them. So when you see another girl struggling with her confidence k the right people,and family.
