Public Speaking is an aspect of Communication that has to do with addressing a large audience and in most cases for a formal matter, that is something that is not private or personal. <br>
It could be in a team work, debate presentation, business or project presentation or pitching an idea, a Talk show, motivational massage to an audience or even preaching. As long as it has to do with addressing a group of persons, small or large, or people who are not personally related to you, it is Public Speaking. Thus is could take place in your school, church, neighborhood, a concert, conference or any organized gathering. <br>
 <br>
The main purpose of PUBLIC SPEAKING is to pass information to a group of persons with the aim of convincing them to accept your ideas, change their orientation/perceptions or see things from your own point of view with regards to the matter or topic you are speaking. <br>
In other words, as future career ladies, everyone of you, dear girls, are going to be doing a lot of Public Speaking, first in your schools, churches, interviews, conferences, business meetings, your work place, governmental and political settings, the international stages, the list is endless... And to attain this, you must start from NOW. Though, from what I have read from most of you here, am convinced many of you have being into public speaking already... <br>
If we have such smart girls here can you indicate with a  YES and kindly tell the house where you spoke before an audience? Maybe at school, church or any other place <br>
 <br>
 CHALLENGES: <br>
The most common challenge of Public Speaking is FEAR... Yes, what we commonly refer to as STAGE FRIGHT, and this often make us nervous and forgetful... I guess there's nothing as dreadful as preparing and rehearsing a nice speech or argument, only to stand before the audience and everything disappears from your head, making you tongue tight, very embarrassing, right?üòí <br>
But, permit me to tell you today that STAGE FRIGHT is just a negative projection of our thoughts. It's a fear that you will not be able to say the right things or the audience may not accept your speech or some one is going to notice all the errors in everything you are saying, even when you have not started yet, thus, even before your audience hear what you have to say, you have written yourself off!  <br>
And the reason behind this is A POOR SELF ESTEEM and lack of confidence. <br>
 <br>
2. SHYNESS: This is also closely related to your self esteem or self evaluation. A shy person always feel less of herself, no matter the talents, grace, beauty and Intelligence she carries. Thus, it's not a question of not knowing what to do or say, but a question of not being able to stand boldly and talk in front of others. I guess a few of us fall into this category... Today will be a turning point for YOU, going forward! <br>
 <br>
. And the last challenge is... <br>
 <br>
 UNPREPAREDNESS: This refers to a lack of planning or the absence of a step by step outline for your speech or presentation. Jumping on the stage without adequate preparations always lead to chaos! üôÜüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
 <br> <br>
Now to some of the questions asked already, how can we overcome shyness and the challenges of Public Speaking?
 <br> <br>
So, how can we overcome the challenges of Public Speaking? What are the FACTORS to consider when it comes to Public Speaking
 <br> <br>
1. YOU.... Surprised? Well don't be, because as the one who will be standing before the crowd, doing most of the talking and holding the center stage, you are the most important factor when it comes to Public Speaking. <br>
Am glad we have already talked about Self Esteem and Personal Grooming, that is, hygiene, these two are very important in public speaking, because knowing ALL EYES will be on you immediately you take the stage, your appearance is therefore very important, from your head to your toes, because a beautiful, perfect look always boost your confidence, and also makes it easy for you to wear a sweet smile.  <br>
So rule number 1. is Be CONFIDENT and be  YOURSELF  <br>
 <br>
2. YOUR AUDIENCE... Before taking the stage and while preparing your speech or presentation, you must have a good understanding of the audience or people you will be speaking to. Their age, level of education, language and their expectations. This will guide you in preparing your speech and the kind of language or grammar to use in your speech delivery.  <br>
The main rule here is ALWAYS keep it SIMPLE. Use words or grammar that is easily understood by your audience and speak CLEARLY, too. <br>
 <br> 
3. CONNECT: In giving speeches, you must be able to connect with your audience, by keeping eye contact and using good facial expressions as well as good body language, smile when necessary, take short but confident steps, use your hands and make eye contact and if you are the really shy type, just look slightly above your audience heads, it will still appears as if you are keeping eye contact.
 <br> <br>
 . PREPARE AND PLAN... You must PLAN your speech. Have a step by step outline of your speech, if allowed, make short notes of the key points, rehearse your speech well before the main presentation day, and rehearse before your mirror too, read through your speech thoroughly, make sure you have a good introduction and a convincing conclusion. Ensure your message is well passed and your audience will surely flows with you!
 <br> <br>
One more thing, ALWAYS remember that the ONLY person who knows your speech is YOU, so even if you make a mistake no one is going to know EXCEPT you allow them by your expressions
